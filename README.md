## 🚀 Overview
The goal of this repository is to showcase my ability to use Python for data science. Each notebook addresses a different dataset and uses various libraries to extract meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Environment:** Google Colab
- **Key Libraries:**
  - `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `NumPy`: For numerical computing and N-dimensional arrays.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: For data visualization and linear regression plots.
  - `Scikit-learn`: For building machine learning models and regression analysis.

## 📁 Projects Included

1. **Programming Languages Trends** – An analysis of the popularity and evolution of various programming languages.
2. **Seaborn & Linear Regression** – Utilizing advanced visualization techniques to find correlations and trends in data.
3. **Computation with NumPy** – Implementing efficient mathematical operations using N-dimensional arrays.
4. **Google Trends & Data Visualization** – Using search interest data to visualize trends and compare different topics over time.
5. **Data Exploration with Pandas (College Majors)** – Analyzing salary data and career outcomes based on different college majors.
6. **Lego Dataset Analysis** – Exploring the evolution of Lego sets, themes, and parts throughout the decades.
7. **Google Play Store App Analytics** – Cleaning and analyzing thousands of apps to identify trends in ratings, categories, and pricing.
8. **Nobel Prize Analysis** – A deep dive into the history, demographics, and patterns of Nobel Prize winners over the years.
9. **Dr. Semmelweis Handwashing Discovery** – An investigation into the history of handwashing and its impact on mortality rates in clinics, analyzing the discovery that handwashing saves lives.
10. **Multivariable Regression & Valuation Model** – Building a house price valuation model using multivariable regression techniques to analyze the relationship between multiple features and property values.
